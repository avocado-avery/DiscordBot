DiscordBot

This is a simple Python Discord bot created for my Computer Science 1 class project.

It demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including:

    Loops (for, while)

    Conditionals (if-else, if-elif-else)

    continue and break

    Lists, 2D lists, and dictionaries

    Functions

    Basic string manipulation

The bot allows users to interact by selecting questions from a menu or running specific commands like grading or age categorization.
